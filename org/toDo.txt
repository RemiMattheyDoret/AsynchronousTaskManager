Add README

Ensure it compiles on UBELIX

Write Gooogletest

Really think of having a library that can be usedd by ane xtenral user. The big while loop should be in main. AsynchronousTaskManager, should have a 'submit' method reading the input. The logo should be in printLogo and also printVersion.

Explicitely delete copy assignment and copy construct of AsynchronousTaskManager.

rename 'AsynchronousTaskManager' to 'AsynchronousTaskManagerAPI'. Have TaskManager takes a Command

return status do not just print it.

Ensure we can call executable form CLI with --version and --help

Debug

reread instructions from Pierrangelo

README, UML diagram, and explainations

Watch for possibility for user to instantiate a class like Task. Might better have a private constructor andd friend ATM (or be nested private in ATM).







*** Not important ***

Allow too referr to tasks with task_ID but then I must rerturn that ID at the 'start' command

Allocate ressources and measure ressources of tasks.

Ensure start returns the taskID and not only print it... maybe. Dunno.

Ensure process is not duplicated or kept around for nothing.

Improve makefile

Add progress to TaskCPP
