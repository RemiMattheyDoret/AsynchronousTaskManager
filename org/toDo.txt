*** important ***

Make makefile create libary and then statically link to it for both the main exe and the tests exe. Clean Makefil. (-lgtest only for make test, -pthrraed only on Linux, rremve warning messages)

finish README

Ensure it compiles on UBELIX

clean code and comments

Funny hard wired tasks

Pass file names for CPP tasks or at leeast inform theee user of wheree the stuff was printed. Or maybe variable number of arguments passed to TaskCPP. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1657883/variable-number-of-arguments-in-c

replace clang++ by g++



*** middle importance ***

Put all classes in TaskManager and make test friend of them. Should I?

Find a solution for erturning all statuses.

Keeep wirting googletest. In particular improve the testing of processController


*** Not important ***

Watch for possibility for user to instantiate a class like Task. Might better have a private constructor andd friend ATM (or be nested private in ATM).

Order status output (by status and then alphabetically within each status or in order in which they were started?)

Allow too referr to tasks with task_ID but then I must rerturn that ID at the 'start' command

Allocate ressources and measure ressources of tasks.

Ensure start returns the taskID and not only print it... maybe. Dunno.

Ensure process is not duplicated or kept around for nothing.

Improve makefile

Add progress to TaskCPP

Possibility forr user to manipulate Task object itself

User interface that parse --options in order to free the ordering at which data is inputted.
